# UBER-SUPPLY-DEMAND-GAP
Business Understanding:

You may have some experience of travelling to and from the airport. Have you ever used Uber or any other cab service for this travel? Did you at any time face the problem of cancellation by the driver or non-availability of cars?

Well, if these are the problems faced by customers, these very issues also impact the business of Uber. If drivers cancel the request of riders or if cars are unavailable, Uber loses out on its revenue.

The aim of analysis is to identify the root cause of the problem (i.e. cancellation and non-availability of cars) and recommend ways to improve the situation
and to analyze Uber trip data to identify supply-demand gaps and uncover insights that can help reduce cancellations and improve customer satisfaction during peak hours.
